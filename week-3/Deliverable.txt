# Week 3 Deliverable

This week, you will be making your React App actually do things!

## Adding State

In Apps.js, intialize a piece state called "sources" using useState(). Inside the useState function, pass in an array of JSON objects, each of which has the source's number, name, and associated email. 

Use the map() function to populate the Sources component with each of these objects.

## Delete Button

When the user presses the delete button, call a function in App.js that deletes that source from the state.

## Adding a source

When the user submits a source, add that source to the state. THiS IS HARD-- use [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginner-react-project-build-basic-forms-using-react-hooks/) (and reach out to me) for help! 

When you are done, your application will be fully functioning! However, because these changes are just on the frontend, the state will not save on page refresh.
